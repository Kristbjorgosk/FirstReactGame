# TIC TAC TOE GAME

I decided to follow the turtorial from the react website, [here is the link to it](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

I did so, so I would understand better what I was doing as they break it down very well. I did change the code quite a bit though (you can see their final version on the link above)

I wrote comments in between so I understood what was happening.
